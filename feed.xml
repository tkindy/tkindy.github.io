I’d only found the problem after I’d published my changes, and even though I’m sure no one’s visiting my website, I didn’t like the idea of breaking the public version during testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first found the problem, I tried recreating it on my laptop using mobile emulation in Firefox. However, the problem wasn’t manifesting there. I wanted to test out my site locally but on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I host my site on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;, I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, a static site generator, to… well, statically generate my site. During development, Jekyll will run a local webserver you can connect to to test out your local changes. Changing any file causes Jekyll to regenerate your site automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to connect from my laptop using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt;. But I wasn’t sure if it was even possible to connect from my phone to the webserver running on my laptop given how much more locked down networking is when using Xfinity’s router and service (definitely a blog post for another day).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I found my laptop’s IP address&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; ip address
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This returned several addresses; the loopback address (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt;), several for my WiFi interface, and a couple for an interface named &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker0&lt;/code&gt; which I’m assuming is somehow involved in Docker networking. As for the several for my WiFi interface, it was assigned one IPv4 address, and several IPv6 addresses with odd keywords after them that I don’t really understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I took the WiFi IPv4 address while the Jekyll server was running and tried connecting to that from my phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/jekyll-connection-refused.png&quot; alt=&quot;connection refused&quot; class=&quot;tall&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Connection refused&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The connection was refused. I was thinking that maybe I needed to open the port on my laptop’s firewall. I run Ubuntu, and after some searching, I found the command to do so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; sudo ufw allow 4000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where 4000 is the default Jekyll port. I tried connecting again, but still got a “Connection refused” message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know much about networking (I really enjoyed the class on the subject in college, but a lot of it’s slipped my mind), so I wasn’t really sure what was going on. I did notice that even when I used my laptop’s IP from my laptop, I still couldn’t connect to the site, so it seemed like something was wrong with the Jekyll server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked the options and found an option that sounded promising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; bundle exec jekyll help serve
jekyll serve -- Serve your site locally

Usage:

  jekyll serve [options]

Options:
...
-H, --host [HOST]  Host to bind to
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I searched online and found &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/16608698&quot;&gt;this Stack Overflow answer&lt;/a&gt; which said to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt; for the host parameter to let Jekyll bind to all IP addresses, not just &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt;. I added that option, tried again from my phone, and…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/jekyll-connection-success.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;success!&quot; class=&quot;tall&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Success!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… it worked! Now, I could try out different solutions or changes and see both how they look on desktop and mobile without having to screw with my public site. This was super useful in testing out fixes for my mobile flexbox issue.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In my last post, I talked about a problem I’d had with flexbox on iOS.

The biggest housekeeping task was throwing out Bootstrap since I was really only using it for the grid layout. In its place, I decided to try out flexbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re unfamiliar with flexbox, MDN has &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/flexbox&quot;&gt;a great tutorial series on it&lt;/a&gt;. At its core, it’s a CSS mechanism for flexibly laying out elements in one dimension (either horizontally or vertically). &lt;a href=&quot;https://tylerkindy.com&quot;&gt;My site’s homepage&lt;/a&gt; now uses flexbox to display my picture and the accompanying text side-by-side in a responsive way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flexbox-homepage.png&quot; alt=&quot;current homepage&quot; class=&quot;wide&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Homepage built with flexbox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This worked great when I viewed it on my laptop. But after I’d published my changes, I checked it out on my phone, and the image was huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flexbox-large-image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;supersized me&quot; class=&quot;tall&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Supersized me&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, this behavior didn’t show up in Firefox’s mobile emulator. I was confused because I had the following CSS rule:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.me-img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;flex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;300px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should mean that the image starts at 300px by default and can shrink if there isn’t enough space, but it can’t grow. However, as you can see, the image appears to be larger than that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I still haven’t been able to figure out what’s happening here. As a workaround, I included a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;max-width&lt;/code&gt; constraint on the image of the same size as the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;flex-basis&lt;/code&gt;. That seems to have properly clamped the size on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/flexbox-normal-image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;regular-sized me&quot; class=&quot;tall&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Regular-sized me&lt;/figcaption&gt;
