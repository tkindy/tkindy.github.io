    <h1>Trouble with flexbox on iOS</h1>
<p><i>25 May 2020</i></p>

<p>In preparation for starting this blog, I decided to clean up my website a bit. The biggest housekeeping task was throwing out Bootstrap since I was really only using it for the grid layout. In its place, I decided to try out flexbox.</p>

<p>If you’re unfamiliar with flexbox, MDN has <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/flexbox">a great tutorial series on it</a>. At its core, it’s a CSS mechanism for flexibly laying out elements in one dimension (either horizontally or vertically). <a href="https://tylerkindy.com">My site’s homepage</a> now uses flexbox to display my picture and the accompanying text side-by-side in a responsive way.</p>

<figure class="centered">
  <img src="/assets/images/flexbox-homepage.png" alt="current homepage" class="wide" />
  <figcaption>Homepage built with flexbox</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This worked great when I viewed it on my laptop. But after I’d published my changes, I checked it out on my phone, and the image was huge.</p>

<figure class="centered">
  <img src="/assets/images/flexbox-large-image.jpg" alt="supersized me" class="tall" />
  <figcaption>Supersized me</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For whatever reason, this behavior didn’t show up in Firefox’s mobile emulator. I was confused because I had the following CSS rule:</p>

<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">.me-img</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">flex</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">0</span> <span class="m">1</span> <span class="m">300px</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This should mean that the image starts at 300px by default and can shrink if there isn’t enough space, but it can’t grow. However, as you can see, the image appears to be larger than that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flex-basis</code>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I still haven’t been able to figure out what’s happening here. As a workaround, I included a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">max-width</code> constraint on the image of the same size as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flex-basis</code>. That seems to have properly clamped the size on mobile.</p>

<figure class="centered">
  <img src="/assets/images/flexbox-normal-image.jpg" alt="regular-sized me" class="tall" />
  <figcaption>Regular-sized me</figcaption>
</figure>
